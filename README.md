IPsea is a peer-to-peer platform to monetize  intellectual property (IP) files

## Project Description

An IP-Driven Marketplace that connects innovators, entrepreneurs & capital through IP NFTs.

Transaction Structures   
• Access to proprietary files  
• Rights to use IP (“IP as a service”)  
• Ownership transfer of IP (total & fractional)  
• Crowdfunding for business plans  

Revenue Sources:  
  8.5% service fee per successful transaction

• Weak governance & regulatory infrastructure  
• Limited access to growth capital

## Development Roadmap
We will require 6 months to complete this project. We intend to hav 2 developers full-time and 1 part-time, at a total cost of $350,000.  

Example milestones:  
* Implement Frontend (weeks 0 - 10)  
* Implement Backend (weeks 11 - 18)  
* Implement Contract (weeks 19 - 22)  
* Implement Test Version (weeks 23 - 24)  

Ideally, we can receive payments in 3 disbursements, one at the beginning of the grant, one after implementation of Test Version and last payment when the development work is completed.

We would be willing to consider part payment in SCRTs, up to 13%.

## MARKET OPPORTUNITY
In a knowledge-based economy, real innovation can add incredible value to economic development. IPsea bridges the gap between intellectual talent (which births IP) & entrepreneurs that have a knack for identifying true innovation.
